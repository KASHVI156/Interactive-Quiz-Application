            question: "What is the value of œÄ (pi) rounded to two decimal places?",

            options: ["3.12", "3.14", "3.16", "3.18"],

            correctAnswer: 1,

            explanation: "œÄ (pi) is approximately equal to 3.14159... When rounded to two decimal places, it is 3.14."

            question: "Which of the following is not a perfect square?",

            options: ["1", "4", "9", "15"],

            correctAnswer: 3,

            explanation: "15 is not a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer by itself. The perfect squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc."

        {

            question: "What is the next number in the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ___?",
            options: ["19", "20", "21", "22"],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "The next number in the Fibonacci sequence is 
            21. Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 13 + 8 = 21."

            question: "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15",
            options: ["5", "10", "4", "5.5"],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "To solve for x, we subtract 5 from both sides to get 2x = 10, then divide both sides by 2 to get x = 5."
        },
        {
            question: "If a triangle has interior angles of 60¬∞, 60¬∞, and 60¬∞, what type of triangle is it?",
