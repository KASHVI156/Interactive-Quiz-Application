            question: "What is the next number in the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ___?",
            options: ["19", "20", "21", "22"],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "The next number in the Fibonacci sequence is 
            21. Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 13 + 8 = 21."
